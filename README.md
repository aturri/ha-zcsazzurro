# ZCS Azzurro Integration for Home Assistant

All supported ZCS Azzurro inverters / energy meters will show a status sensor and sensors represnting generating power/energy. According to device types and installation, there are some other sensors representing the power/energy consuming, auto-consuming, charging, discharging, importing, exporting, as well as batteries charge status. Note that these sensors are disabled by default, they need to be manually enabled on device page.

This integration lets you configure an authentication to ZCS Azzurro portal and then you can add inverters through integration page on frontend.

## Installation

Make sure you have the asked ZCS Azzurro credentials to use this integration. Contact their support and they will give you a client code and an auth key.
If you have an existing integration with the name "zcsazzurro" you are recommended to remove it before attemping to install this one.

### Preferred download method

- Use HACS, search for ZCS Azzurro integration and download it.
- Restart Home Assistant

### Manual download method

- Copy all files from custom_components/zcsazzurro in this repo to your config custom_components/zcsazzurro
- Restart Home Assistant

### Setup

First thing you have to do is to specify in your `configuration.yaml` file the credentials that are required for this integration:
```
zcsazzurro:
  auth_key: xxx
  client_code: xxx
```

After modifying this, restart Home Assistant and go to `Integrations` > `Add Integration` and select `ZCS Azzurro`. Sometimes you must refresh the browser cache to find the integration.

Pick serial number of your inverter / energy meter and insert it to complete the config flow: a new device with serial number inserted will appear. Add a new `ZCS Azzurro` config entry for each device you want to add.

### Development

There are many ways to setup a development environment.

#### Dev Container

The recommended option is to use the VS Code Dev Container. You need to have Docker installed.

1. For best performance, clone the repo in a named volume.
1. Open a new, empty window in VS Code.
1. Press `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` and select `Dev Containers: Clone Respository in Named Container Volume`
1. Fill in your repo and your chosen names at the prompts
1. Wait for the container to be built
1. You can customize `config/configuration.yaml` by adding your credentials, as required before adding the integration

1. Press `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `Run Home Assistant on port 9123`.
1. Wait for Home Assistant to start and go to http://localhost:9123/.
1. Walk through the Home Assistant first-launch UI.
1. Go to http://localhost:9123/config/integrations, click `Add Integration` and add the `ZCS Azzurro` integration.
1. To debug, press `F5` to attach to the Home Assistant running in the container.
1. Your configuration.yaml will be persistent (survives rebuild of container).

#### Without a Dev Container

Alternatively, you can run Home Assistant directly on your machine/WSL2. The following procedure works fine in the hands of the maintainer developing with VS Code on WSL2/Windows.

- Make sure you have at least python3.11 installed on your WSL.
- Create a fork on github

```
$ git clone https://github.com/{your_user}/ha-zcsazzurro
$ cd ha-zcsazzurro
$ make install_dev
```

Home Assistant has defined a code style. Run `make lint` before pushing your changes to align with the peferred style.

There are many ways to test the integration, three examples are:

- run Home Assistant in the development container as described above

- copy all files in `custom_comonents/ha-zcsazzurro` to `custom_components/ha-zcsazzurro` in your HA configuration directory
- mount `custom_components/ha-zcsazzurro` into a HA development container

### Debugging and filing issues

If you find bugs or other issues please download diagnostic information from the ZCS Azzurro integration card or from the device page and attach the file to your issue report.
